# Blog, based on MVC

This was my first hobby project, to learn MVC pattern back in 2013-2014.

# Installing

Copy the files to the server, and go to the ```/_install``` in the browser, and fill out the forms.
It should install the database files, and everything should be OK.

There are some known bugs, but in the near future, I'm not planning to resolve those. It was fun writing these codes, but right now I'm focusing on other projects.

# Design

The design it's not mine. Neither of it. Some templates use bootstrap, some of it uses other kind of free templates.
I was concentrating on the MVC-PHP, not for the HTML/CSS/JS.

# License
For the PHP files (except phpmailer, and some other libs) you can do with this code, what you want. I don't care.
